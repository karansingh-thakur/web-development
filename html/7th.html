    <p> <b> Social media </b> are interactive computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing of
        information, ideas, career interests, and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. The
        variety of stand-alone and built-in social media services currently available introduces challenges of

        Users usually access social media services via web-based apps on desktops and laptops, or download services that
        offer social media functionality to their mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). As users engage with
        these electronic services, they create highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities, and
        organizations can share, co-create, discuss, participate and modify user-generated content or self-curated
        content posted online.[1] Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation. Additionally, social media are
        used to document memories, learn about and explore things, advertise oneself and form friendships as well as the
        growth of ideas from the creation of blogs, podcasts, videos, and gaming sites.[5] This changing relationship
        between human and technology is the focus of the emerging fields of technoself studies.
