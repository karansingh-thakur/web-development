            <li>Cloud Computing is simply – the ability to use network of remote servers to store , manage and process
                the
                data</li>
            <li>Cloud computing is the delivery of shared computing resources, software or data — as a service and

                through the internet</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing refers to manipulating, configuring, and accessing the hardware and software resources
                remotely. It offers online data storage, infrastructure, and application.

        <p id="Benefits_of_Cloud_Computing"><b>Benefits of Cloud Computing</b></p>
        Cloud Computing has numerous advantages. Some of them are listed below
        <ul>
            <li>One can access applications as utilities, over the Internet.</li>
            <li>One can manipulate and configure the applications online at any time.</li>
            <li>It does not require to install a software to access or manipulate cloud application.</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing offers online development and deployment tools, programming runtime environment
                through <b>PaaS model</b>.</li>
            <li>Cloud resources are available over the network in a manner that provide platform independent access to
                any
                type of clients.</li>
            <li> Cloud Computing offers <b>on-demand self-service</b>. The resources can be used without interaction
                with
                cloud service provider.</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing is highly cost effective because it operates at high efficiency with optimum
                utilization. It
                just requires an Internet connection.</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing offers load balancing that makes it more reliable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="Risks_related_to_Cloud_Computing"><b>Risks related to Cloud Computing </b></p>
        Although cloud Computing is a promising innovation with various benefits in the world of computing, it comes
        with
        risks. Some of them are discussed below:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Security and Privacy</b></li>
            <div>It is the biggest concern about cloud computing. Since data management and infrastructure management in
                cloud is provided by third-party, it is always a risk to handover the sensitive information to cloud
                service
                providers. </div>
            <div>Although the cloud computing vendors ensure highly secured password protected accounts, any sign of
                security breach may result in loss of customers and businesses.</div>
            <li><b> Lock In </b></li>
            <div>It is very difficult for the customers to switch from one <b>Cloud Service Provider (CSP)</b> to
                another.
                It
                results in dependency on a particular CSP for service. </div>
            <li><b> Isolation Failure</b></li>
            <div>This risk involves the failure of isolation mechanism that separates storage, memory, and routing
                between
                the different tenants. </div>
            <li><b>Management Interface Compromise</b></li>
            <div>In case of public cloud provider, the customer management interfaces are accessible through the
                Internet.
            </div>
            <li><b> Insecure or Incomplete Data Deletion </b></li>
            <div>It is possible that the data requested for deletion may not get deleted. It happens because either of
                the
                following </div>
        </ul>
