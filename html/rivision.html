    <h2>Sai Baba of Shirdi</h2>
    <hr>
    <h6>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5>
        <i>"Sai Nath" redirects here. For the university, see Sai Nath University.</i>
        <p> <b>Sai Baba of Shirdi</b> (died 15 October 1918), also known as <strong> Shirdi Sai Baba</strong>, was an
            Indian spiritual master who
            is regarded by his devotees to be a manifestation of Sri Dattaguru[2] and identified as a saint and a fakir.
            He was revered by both his Hindu and Muslim devotees during, as well as after his lifetime.</p>

        <p>According to accounts from his life, he preached the importance of <i> realization of the self and criticized
                love towards perishable things</i>. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness,
            helping
            others, charity, contentment, inner peace and devotion to the God and guru. He stressed the importance of
            surrender to the true <i> Satguru</i>, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the
            disciple
            through the jungle of spiritual training.</p>
        <p>Sai Baba also condemned distinction based on religion or caste. It remains unclear if he was a Muslim or a
            Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba.[4] His teachings combined elements of Hinduism and
            Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived,[5] practised both Hindu and
            Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions and took samadhi in Shirdi.
            One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone's Master is One), is
            associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said Look to me, and I shall look to
            you[3] and Allah tera bhala karega.[6] He was said to be an incarnation of Dattatreya.[7]</p>

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Sai Baba's date of birth including his birthplace remains unknown, however it is accepted that his birthday
            falls on 28th September [8]. Most definitive information about Shirdi Sai Baba tends to be derived from a
            book called Shri Sai Satcharitra written by a disciple called Hemadpant (also known as Annasaheb Dabholkar /
            Govind Raghunath) in 1922 in Marathi.[9] The book itself is a compilation based on accounts by his various
            disciples and Hemadpant's personal observations of Sai Baba from 1910 onwards</p>
        <p>Sai Baba's real name remains unknown. The name Sai was given to him by Mahalsapati[a] when he arrived at
            Shirdi, a town now in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. The word Sai refers to a religious mendicant[12]
            but can also mean God. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages the term Baba is an honorific
            signifying grandfather, father, old man or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes holy father, saintly father or
            (venerable) poor old man.</p>
        <p>Some of Sai Baba's disciples became famous as spiritual figures and saints, such as Mahalsapati, a priest of
            the Khandoba temple in Shirdi and Upasni Maharaj. He was revered by other saints as well, such as Saint
            Bidkar Maharaj, Saint Gagangiri Maharaj, Saint Janakidas Maharaj and Sati Godavari Mataji.[13][14] Sai Baba
            referred to several saints as 'my brothers', especially the disciples of Swami Samartha of Akkalkot</p>

        <h4>Early years</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Although Sai Baba's origins are unknown, some indications exist that suggest that he was born not far from
            Shirdi. Historical researches into genealogies in Shirdi give support to the theory that Baba could have
            been born with the name Haribhau Bhusari.[15] Baba was notorious for giving vague, misleading and
            contradictory replies to questions concerning his parentage and origins, brusquely stating the information
            was unimportant. He had reportedly stated to a close follower, Mahalsapati, that he has been born of
            Deshastha Brahmin[16] parents in the village of Pathri and had been entrusted into the care of a fakir in
            his infancy.[17] On another occasion, Baba reportedly said that the fakir's wife had left him in the care of
            a Hindu guru, Venkusa of Selu and that he had stayed with Venkusa for 12 years as his disciple.[18] This
            dichotomy has given rise to two major theories regarding Baba's background, with the majority of writers
            supporting the Hindu background over the Islamic, while others combine both theories (that Sai Baba was
            first brought up by a fakir and then by a guru).</p>
        <p>Baba reportedly arrived at the village of Shirdi in the Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra, India, when he
            was about sixteen years old. Although there is no agreement among biographers about the date of this event,
            it is generally accepted that Baba stayed in Shirdi for three years, disappeared for a year and returned
            permanently around 1858, just after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. This posits a possible birth year of
            1838.[19] He led an ascetic life, sitting motionless under a neem tree and meditating while sitting in an
            asana. The Sai Satcharita recounts the reaction of the villagers</p>

        <h4>Return to Shirdi</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Sai Baba returned to Shirdi in 1858. He appeared at the Khandoba Mandir in Shirdi. The temple priest,
            Mahalsapati, upon seeing him for the first time, welcomed him by saying 'Aao, Sai!' ('Come Sai'). From then
            on, He was known by the name (Sai Baba).</p>

        <p>Around this time he adopted his famous style of dressing, consisting of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe
            and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported
            'long hair flowing down to the end of his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head
            shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the
            kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing.[23] This attire contributed to Baba's identification
            as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly
            Hindu village.[24]</p>

            alt="sai" height="200" width="150">
        <p>For four to five years, Baba lived under a neem tree and often wandered for long periods in the jungle around
            Shirdi. His manner was said to be withdrawn and uncommunicative as he undertook long periods of
            meditation.[25] He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque and lived
            a solitary life there, surviving by begging for alms and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In
            the mosque, he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a dhuni, from which he gave sacred ash
            ('Udi') to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He
            performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application of ashes. Sai Baba also
            delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the Ramayana and Bhagavat Gita
            for Hindus and Qur'an for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God's
            name (dhikr, and often expressed himself in a cryptic manner with the use of parables, symbols and
            allegories).</p>

        <h4>Final years and death (Samadhi)</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>In August 1918, Shirdi Sai Baba told some of his devotees that he would soon be "leaving his mortal body"
            (dying).[33] Towards the end of September, he had high fever and stopped eating.[34] As his condition
            deteriorated, he asked his disciples to recite holy texts to him and continued to meet visitors. On 15
            October 1918, he breathed his last. The day coincided with the Hindu calendar date that year for
            Vijayadashami.[35][36] His remains were interred at "Buti Wada" in Shirdi, after which it became a place of
            worship known today as Shree Samadhi Mandir or Shirdi Sai Baba Temple</p>
        <h4>Teachings and practices</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Sai Baba opposed all persecution based on religion or caste. He was an opponent of religious orthodoxy â€”
            Christian, Hindu and Muslim.[37]

            Sai Baba encouraged his devotees to pray, chant God's name, and read holy scriptures. He told Muslims to
            study the Qur'an and Hindus to study texts such as the Ramayana, Bhagavad Gita and Yoga Vasistha.[38] He was
            impressed by the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita and encouraged people to follow it in their own lives.[39]
            He advised his devotees and followers to lead a moral life, help others, love every living being without any
            discrimination, and develop two important features of character: faith (Shraddha) and patience (Saburi). He
            criticised atheism.[40]

                alt="sai" height="200" width="150">
            In his teachings, Sai Baba emphasised the importance of performing one's duties without attachment to
            earthly matters and of being content regardless of the situation. In his personal practice, Sai Baba
            observed worship procedures belonging to Islam; he shunned any kind of regular rituals but allowed the
            practice of Salah, chanting of Al-Fatiha, and Qur'an readings at Muslim festival times.[41] Occasionally
            reciting the Al-Fatiha, Baba enjoyed listening to mawlid and qawwali accompanied with the tabla and sarangi
            twice daily.</p>
